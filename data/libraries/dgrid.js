Or easily create your own extensions to meet your specific needs.</li><li>Skinning - dgrid ships with several default themes including the Claro theme to match the popular Dijit theme. You can easily customize dgrid through well documented CSS and/or jQuery ThemeRoller classes.</li><li>Mobile Support - dgrid has been tested to work on iOS and Android browsers, providing efficient rendering for your data on the go.</li><li>A11y - The Keyboard mixin adds keyboard handling functionality.
