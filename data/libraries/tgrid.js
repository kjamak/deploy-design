    'HTML5 ready fully functional grid with Knockout.JS and AngularJS support.',
  content:
    '<p>TypeScript, AngularJS and Knockout compatible, fully customizable grid with rich functionality.</p><p>This plugin was created when i was upgrading a small framework of mine and i needed a table to present the records. It was then when i first heard about jQuery library and began to study it. Then i have seen tablesorter plugin and thought it was exact thing that i needed to my project. I needed to add some functionality to it, though. Firstly, i noticed that when i filled tablesorter with a big ammount of data and turned &#39;pagination&#39; option on, my browsers [firefox and opera] just went nuts when it came to memory usage. So i thought i could add my own method of pagination. Then, i wanted to add some filtering and thirdly, i needed to combine it with the models of my framework (so that the tablesorter would sort of &quot;create&quot; the sql queries for me. I think i have succeded :)</p><h4 id="preview-">Preview:</h4><h5 id="filter-by-value">Filter by value</h5><p><img src="/images/libraries/tgrid/tgrid-filtering-by-value-example.png" alt="tgrid filter by value" title="tgrid filter by value"></p><h5 id="data-pagination">Data pagination</h5><p><img src="/images/libraries/tgrid/tgrid-pagination-example.png" alt="tgrid data pagination" title="tgrid data pagination"></p>',
